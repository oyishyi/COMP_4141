#  Proofs and algorithms  { #chapproofs }

>_"Let's not try to define knowledge, but try to define zero-knowledge."_, Shafi Goldwasser.


_Proofs_ have captured human imagination for thousands of years, ever since the publication of Euclid's _Elements_, a book second only to the bible in the number of editions printed.

Plan:

* Proofs and algorithms

* Interactive proofs

* Zero knowledge proofs

* Propositions as types, Coq and other proof assistants.
