Please open a different issue for each chapter, with the **chapter name** in the title - thank you!

Please edit the fields below

**Chapter name**: The names of the chapter and section(s) where the typos/bugs/are. (Please use _names_, not _numbers_, since the numbers tend to change).

**List of bugs/typos**


Please don't refer to page numbers or even section numbers since they tend to change - section titles are best. Also, please give some context (sentence before/after the issue) to make it easier for me to find it - thanks!

2. bug 2
