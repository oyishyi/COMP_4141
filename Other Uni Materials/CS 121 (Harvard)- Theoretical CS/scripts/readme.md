# Markdown book scripts

__Boaz Barak__

This is a set of scripts that I use in combination with pandoc to produce the book 
"Introduction To Theoretical Computer Science" ( https://introtcs.org )

It builds on pandoc and panflute.

THIS IS NOT A WORKING PACKAGE. It is a snapshot of part of my setup at this current point in time.
Some parts of it are hardwired to this particular book and my particular Windows setup.

However, if you are proficient in Python and other tools, you should be able to adapt it to yours.

At the moment I am using an HTML template that is an adaptation of the Bookdown template (itself adapted from the Gitbook project) and a LaTeX template that is an adaptation of the Tufte Latex template. However, the scripts can be modified to work with other templates as well.

These scripts are based on an original version written by David Steurer and used for our  lecture notes on the Sum of Squares algorithm https://sumofsquares.org
