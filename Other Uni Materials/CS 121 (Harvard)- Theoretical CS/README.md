# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

This is the git repository for a book in preparation for an introductory undergraduate course on computer science.
The book is posted (in both html and pdf formats)  on the web page [http://introtcs.org](http://introtcs.org)

Please use the [issues](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls) to post any suggestions, comments, typo fixes, etc.

I am working on improving this text during the spring of 2019.

My priorities are:

* Make the book less "idiosyncratic" - emphasize the models of Boolean Circuits, Turing Machines and RAM machines as opposed to their programming-language variants. As a byproduct I am renaming the programming languages to NAND-CIRC, NAND-TM and NAND-RAM to emphasize their roots and connections to standard models.

* Add exercises.

* More explanations and  proof ideas.

* Make the text more "linear": fewer footnotes and remarks that disrupt the flow of reading.

* Write two chapters: space bounded computation and proofs and programs.

* Adding supplemental code, which will eventually be on [github.com/boazbk/tcscode](https://github.com/boazbk/tcscode)


I am producing the book from the markdown source using 
[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). 
The templates for the LaTeX and HTML versions are derived from   [Tufte LaTeX](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/), [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). You can see the [scripts](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/tree/master/scripts) directory for some of the templates, scripts and  [panflute](http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/) filter I am using.
